# SCP079RadioHack-LabAPI
A plugin for SCP: Secret Laboratory that allows SCP079 to hack into the NTF radio. 

Plugin comes with 2 simple commands:

`scp079radio hack` will put 079 into hack modus. This will suppress 079's normal proximity chat speaker and instead allow 079 to talk and listen to the radio item.

`scp079radio proxy` will toggle the proxy. By default on, if turned off 079's portrait will show up when talking.
